## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Hovik Grigoryan, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am a firm believer that science and engineering should be centered around humans and humanity. Whether that involves creating pieces of technology that improve the quality of our lives or even save lives, or exploring the world around us , mechanical engineering , due to its broadness and universality, is the field that I believe can achieve this best. Currently, my greatest interest and passion lie within the fields of astronomy and aerospace engineering. I believe that the grand mission of space exploration stems from our fundamental human nature, and I am excited to contribute to this field. I am also greatly interested in medicine ; since both of my parents are doctors, I was raised with the idea that helping others is the greatest virtue. I would love to apply my knowledge and experience in engineering to create technologies that improve the lives of people all around the world.
