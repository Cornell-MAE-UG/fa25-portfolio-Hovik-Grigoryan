As part of a class project, my team and I designed and constructed a pulse laser system. The setup utilized a Thyratron tube and a 555-timer integrated circuit, along with supporting components such as diodes, transformers, and resistors. My primary responsibility within the team was the design and implementation of the pulse generation circuit, which controlled the timing and amplitude of the laser pulses. This involved fine-tuning the circuit parameters to achieve stable and precise pulse characteristics, ensuring reliable synchronization between the triggering and discharge stages of the laser system. Through this work, I gained practical experience in high-voltage circuit design, timing control, and pulse electronics integration.
