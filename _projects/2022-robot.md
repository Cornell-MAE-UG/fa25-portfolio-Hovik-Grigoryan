Together with four fellow students, I had the honor of representing Armenia at the FIRST International Robotics Competition held in Geneva, Switzerland. The competition challenge involved designing and constructing a robot capable of performing several coordinated tasks, including: 

- Picking up small spherical balls from the ground 
- Launching the balls into a basket at a specified height 
- Navigating both flat and inclined surfaces 
- Grasping and climbing a bar positioned above the robot 

To meet these requirements, our team developed a four-wheeled robot with a hybrid drive system. The front wheels handled steering and rotation, while the rear wheels provided the main propulsion similar to the dynamics of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. For ball collection, we engineered a pair of sweeping arms that guided the balls into an internal transfer mechanism. This subsystem, driven by a combination of gears and rubber belts, elevated the balls into a high-speed launching system. 

The throwing mechanism employed rapidly rotating wheels to impart sufficient momentum to the balls, allowing for accurate and consistent shots into the basket. Within the team, my primary responsibilities included designing and constructing the driving and launching mechanisms. I also served as the main operator during the competition, controlling the robot’s navigation and shooting systems in real time. 

In addition, I contributed to the software development, using Arduino to program the driving, sweeping, and shooting controls. This project provided valuable experience in robotic systems integration, embedded programming, and real-time control, while also strengthening my teamwork and problem-solving skills in a competitive engineering environment.
