For my fluid mechanics final project, my teammates and I were given an instant coffee maker. Our task was to decompose it, and analyze how various fluid mechanical machines work together to fulfill the task of delivering coffee. 
After taking apart all the protective layers of plastic on the coffee maker, and the circutry which time and synchronize the work of the coffee maker, we were left with several fluid mechanical components, which work in unisome to 1) bring boiled water up into the coffee pods 2) prevent the water from overflowing and spilling into the coffee maker. 
Four tubes and two pumps perform those two main functions. 

In the team, I participated in all the parts of the process. Taking apart the coffee maker, identifying the fluid mechanical components of it and finding out what each does, preparing the slideshow presentation and making the youtube video, where my teammates and I explain how the coffee maker works. 

Find the youtube video attached below.
